# Strend
This year, as part of our project Strend, we have undertaken the following initiatives:

1. We collected around 100 drafters for Rs. 100 each from senior batches and sold them to freshmen for Rs. 140 each, saving them from having to buy a new drafter for Rs. 550, which is only used for one semester mostly.
2. We collected 48 lab coats for Rs. 150 each from senior batches and sold them to freshmen for Rs. 250 each.
3. As the batch of 2019 was vacating, we organized a collection drive and procured around 6 cartons of clothes from various hostels. We donated a third of these clothes to flood-affected individuals living roadside and also contributed to Daan Utsav. For the remaining clothes, we plan to create various items and sell them once the team returns from summer vacation.
4. We collected around 40 mattresses from the batch of 2019, donated 19 usable ones to freshmen and clubs and the rest to a local vendor for recycling.
5. We are currently building prototypes of laundry bags from leftover flex banners from various college events. These waterproof bags have a holding capacity of over 10 kg. We have donated 27 laundry bags to workers living around the college.

These efforts have helped us achieve the following:

We have created an ecosystem within the college for renting equipment needed for only a semester or two. By procuring equipment from senior batches and renting it to freshmen, we generate revenue while accounting for potential damage or wear and tear. This system ensures that equipment is returned after use for the next batch. Through this process, we generated a revenue of Rs. 10,000 while preventing students from paying excessive amounts (Rs. 550 for a drafter and Rs. 350 for a lab coat). Our recycling efforts reduces carbon emissions, contribute to a sustainable future, and support underprivileged individuals, such as freshmen from less affluent families and workers living around the college.
